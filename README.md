- 👋 Hi I'm Beatriz. Currently living in Lisbon. I'm an ESG/Sustainability Consultant with a Physics & Engineering background.
- 👀 I've always been curious about how we can use Big Data to find solutions to complex logistics, mobility and disaster relief challenges. Data has always been my thing so I'm currently looking to learn and practice as much as I can so I can use better tools to deliver improved solutions to clients in my field.
- 🌱 I've got some background in Python and SQL and I'm looking to improve on those and further my knowledge in Machine Learning and AI and anything else that comes my way.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate in all kinds of projects. Any one moment is a good learning moment.
- 📫 You can reach me via my email: beatriz.soeiro@protonmail.com
